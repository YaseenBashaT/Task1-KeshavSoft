## Project Overview  
**AetherFlow** is a sleek, modern, and fully responsive **creative digital agency website** built using **Bootstrap 5** and enhanced with **custom CSS animations, gradients, and interactive UX**.  

It features:  
- **Home Page** – Gradient hero with breathing design theme, service cards, sticky navbar  
- **About Page** – Alternating image-text sections showcasing vision and process  
- **Contact Page** – Elegant, validated contact form with **Formspree.io** integration  

> All components were **remixed and reimagined** from Bootstrap 5 Examples — **never copied** — and elevated with **original styling, typography, and motion**.

## Step-by-Step Development Process  
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Explored [Bootstrap 5 Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) for inspiration |
| 2 | Selected core components: **Navbar, Hero, Cards, Grid, Buttons** |
| 3 | Created structured folders: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `assets/css/`, `assets/js/` |
| 4 | Designed **Home Page** with **purple gradient hero**, breathing headline, and floating CTA |
| 5 | Built **About Page** using **alternating image-text layout** with soft shadows |
| 6 | Developed **Contact Page** with **real-time validated form** using **Formspree.io** |
| 7 | Added **custom CSS** (`style.css`) for gradients, hover lifts, and scroll effects |
| 8 | Implemented **JavaScript** for navbar transparency → solid on scroll |
| 9 | Tested responsiveness across **mobile, tablet, and desktop** using Chrome DevTools |
| 10 |-deployed live via **GitHub Pages** |

## Tools & Resources Used (Full Transparency)  
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Bootstrap 5 CDN** | Responsive framework & utility classes |
| **Bootstrap Docs & Examples** | Reference for layout patterns |
| **Grok (xAI)** | AI-powered code generation, debugging, and optimization |
| **Formspree.io** | Backend-free form handling (real email delivery) |
| **GitHub & GitHub Pages** | Version control + free hosting |
| **Unsplash** | High-quality royalty-free hero & placeholder images |
| **Google Fonts (Space Grotesk)** | Modern, clean typography |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Responsive testing & performance audit |

> **Note:** I used **Grok AI** to generate clean, semantic, and performant code. Every line was reviewed, customized, and fully understood.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions  
| Challenge | How I Solved It |
|---------|-----------------|
| Hero image too dark behind text | Added semi-transparent dark overlay + white text with gradient accent |
| Service cards looked flat | Added **hover lift**, **soft shadows**, and **rounded corners** |
| Navbar overlapped content on mobile | Used `fixed-top` + `pt-5` padding on `<body>` |
| Form not sending emails | Integrated **Formspree.io** with custom success/error messages |
| Text overflow on small screens | Used responsive typography (`display-4` → `h1`) + `text-center` |
| Smooth scroll effect missing | Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` + JS class toggle |

## Learning Journey  
1. **Started** with basic HTML/CSS → **mastered**:  
   - Bootstrap 5 **grid system**, **utilities**, and **component overrides**  
   - **Custom CSS** with gradients, shadows, and transitions  
   - **Responsive design** principles (mobile-first)  
2. Learned to **remix, not replicate** — every section is a unique composition  
3. Gained hands-on experience with **live form submission** and **deployment**  
4. Understood the value of **clean code, semantic HTML, and documentation**
